It's Christmas tomorrow.
And for the first time in 14 years I'm celebrating it in my home country of The Netherlands.
I also visited The Netherlands about 2 years ago.
But this time it feels different.
I can't quite put my finger on it.
Perhaps the whole Christmas atmosphere amplifies whatever I'm feeling.

I honestly don't know what to write.

Maybe I just needed an excuse to wish you all a merry Christmas.
