I've had many blogs in the past, but I still don't know how to blog.
After a year or so I get bored, delete my blog, move on with life, until a friend or
two begin blogging and the itch for me has to be scratched too.

And so now, probably a year or more after <a href="https://famichiki.jp/@dwvcd">Derek</a> and
<a href="https://famichiki.jp/@alanb@mastodon.social">Alan</a> started theirs, here I am
again ready to jump on the bandwagon.

I have a lot to write about. Or maybe I should say that I have a lot I could write about.
On how I moved away from Japan to Abu Dhabi because I felt like it. Life in a new country.
My divorce. The fight for being able to see my daughter. Yes, yes. There are many things
to write about indeed.

But I don't know where to start. Which is problematic because as it so happens to be, getting
started is the precursor to just about anything. But maybe I'll get better over time.

It's nice to have a lil' presence on the web that's truly mine. You know, I can do anything here.
Like my own house. Could cover it in shit if I wanted, and no would be able to do anything about it.
But no one would cover their own house in shit. Probably.

I remember making my first website together with the help of a book when I was 8 or 9 years old.
Browsing through all the possible HTML tags to use.
Back when `blink`, `marquee`, and `frame`'s for layouts were still acceptable if not recommended.

I could make whatever I wanted. Of course, until the 60 minutes of allotted computer time each day was over.
I'd take my book and think about what I would add to my website the next day.
Of course paying for hosting my website creations was out of the question.
So the only person who could see my house covered in ~~shit~~ `marquee`-ed GIFs of ghosts
on a lemon-yellow background was myself.

My mother was quite strict about using the computer not too much.
Of course, now I'm behind one 24/7.
Take that, mom. I'm an adult _(oh?)_ now.

Anyway at the end of the day, I just want to create things, write words somewhere and share them with the world.

That's it. So here we are. It's like I'm 8 again.
