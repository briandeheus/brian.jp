_March 8th, 2025 Update_

I've made some changes to the original post, 
after reflecting on my own emotions at the time.

_Original Post_

I met with my dad today.
For the first time in 25 years.
Technically it's only been 15 years.
But as I told him, that one time didn't really count.

He lives on a small farm. It's adorable. My mom would've loved it.
But they're divorced. So probably not so much these days.
It was the first time I was able to see why my mom and dad were in love at one point.

I've been messaging with my dad for the past few years. He had a stroke 10 years ago.
He wobbles when he walks but is mentally very sharp. He's funny. Kind.
He likes coffee with freshly ground beans, and his wife makes a nice spiced cake.

I last saw him when I was 8.
Most of my memories from those days are gone.
So it was nice to catch up and to be given a chance to get to know my dad.

I learned where he went to school. What he studied. How he met my mom.
How the divorce happened. And what he'd been up to.
He learned about me. How I experienced the divorce. And what I'd been up to.

We had coffee. A few slices of his wife's fresh spiced cake.
We shared a platter of cheese.
It was weird talking to my dad.
Sharing a beer. Casually having a snack.
Just like that. After 25 years.
I had a beer with my dad. I never thought I'd experience that.

I have many questions I still want to ask.
But I had to excuse myself.
I had been there for 2 hours.
It felt like 15 minutes, but it also could've been an entire day.

I'm happy I got to talk to my dad again.
He was absent for a large part of my life.
During my formative years, where a dad would've come in handy there was a void.

And I'm happy with who I am today.
But driving home I had to pull over.
I cried. I cursed the situation of so many years ago.

It's not my mothers fault. It's not my fathers fault.
But I wish my father did more to reach out to me and my brother.
And I wish my mother encouraged me to talk with my father more.
I was 8. What did I know? Nothing. But again, it's been so many
years ago. Does it really matter?
All I can really do is look forward.

Because a lot can happen in 25 years. 
I know my mother has changed.
And I am sure my father has changed just as well.
But I only got to know him over the past few years, as just a dude.
An old dude. Who is my father. My dad. Do I love him?
I don't know. But he's still my dad.
And for now, for me, that's all that matters.

Hey dad. It was awesome to finally meet you.
