Here's my spiced cake recipe. No backstory.

## Ingredients:

* 250 g all-purpose flour
* 8 g baking powder
* 150 g dark brown sugar
* 8 g ground cinnamon
* 1 g ground cloves
* 1 g ground nutmeg
* 1 g salt
* 2 eggs (approx. 100 g total)
* 200 ml whole milk
* 100 ml neutral vegetable oil (e.g. sunflower)
* 50g of raisins

## Recipe:

Turn on your oven, preheat it to 170~ degrees C or around there.

Add the dry ingredients into one bowl, wet ingredients in the next.

Mix together the dry ingredients. Make sure to use a sieve or something to make sure you have no lumpy flour or sugar.
This is very important because you cannot overmix the dough once you add the wets.

Next, mix together the wet ingredients. Whisk 'em together, but don't be too ambitious. 
You don't want to incorporate too much air. Why? I don't know. You just don't.

Take the wet mix, and dump it on the dry mix. You don't have to gently incorporate it. 
Just toss it on there. Alternatively, take the dry mix and dump it on your wet mix.

Now fold it together. It's a rather wet mix all together, but it's important not to overmix. 
It's OK if it's lumpy, because you cleared the actual horrible lumps earlier when mixing the dries.

It's time to fold in the raisins. Again one or two folds is enough. 
You can skip this part if you don't like raisins. No changes needed to the recipe.

Finally pour the mixture in a baking tin that's either lined with baking paper or the sides smeared with butter. 
I don't know how to properly size this, so don't ask me what tin-size. Are they even standardized?
Just find one that looks like it'll hold it. You want fill it to around half-way or 2-thirds up the rim. 
Trust your gut.

## Baking

This cake should be baked at around 170 degrees C for 45 minutes. 
Bake it longer or shorter depending on the size of your baking tin.
You can always jab something long and thin (I use chopsticks) inside to see if the mix has baked well.
Crumbs on the chopsticks without wet mixture means it's done, probably. 
You might actually have stabbed a raisin, don't get tricked by them!

## After baking

Once it's done, take it out and let it cool in the tin for 10 minutes.
After that it's ready to eat. If you want a really gastronomic experience, smear some butter on there.
