                <p>I have thyroid cancer. Finally something new to blog about.
If you frequent my blog or follow me on Mastodon, you know that early December I was hospitalized following a thyroid storm.
A thyroid storm is when your thyroid decides to release all your stored thyroid hormones at once.
Your metabolism shoots up. Your heart rate shoots up. Your anxiety goes through the roof.
And if you’re unlucky the credits to your life start rolling.
I was lucky enough that it was a mild storm, and after 2 days in …</p>

                <p>The quarter has not ended yet, but it is about to. Just 12 more days. Or 13?
Who is keeping track.
At the beginning of the year I set some goals for myself, across 3 disciplines.
Lets see what I have done, what I have not done. And what I am going to do different.
Personal Goals
I am still on track to move to Japan by September 2025. In fact, we actually might arrive earlier in August, July or even June.
All my papers have been submitted to immigration and now we essentially have to play the wai…</p>

                <p>January 1st 2025. I love typing it. 2025-01-01. The first day of the year.
After I shared my 2024-in-review, Famichiki user @slims, shared his,
listing not just highlights of his years but also listing goals.
I really liked that idea, so this year ,thanks @slims for the inspiration, I’m going to set my own goals as well.
I’ll be splitting up my goals in 3 sections. Personal, Professional, and Social. I want to make sure my goals
are attainable so I don’t get dissuaded from giving up if I end up …</p>

                <p>Unless fate has one last trick up it’s sleeve, I will have witnessed my umpteenth changing of the year. 2025.
I remember switching from 1999 to 2000. “We will never live in the 1900s ever again” I recall thinking.
Inflating the gravity of the situation of the changing years,
feeling a sadness of what is essentially an arbitrary numbering of our days.
And now we’re about to close 2024. I like to look back through my images on my phone and see what happened.
Reflect on the good. The bad. The unusu…</p>

                <p>A few years ago, while drinking with some buddies, I ran into a woman named Sarah.
I forgot her last name, but I remember that Sarah was Swiss. Probably.
If it turns out she’s not, she could easily be.
I enjoyed talking to Sarah, she was funny, smart, and had good stories to tell.
As is customary, our drinks were consumed sitting down.
Without fail when I meet new people, my height is one of the first things they will bring up.
But because we sat down, my height probably went unnoticed.
Nothing.…</p>
