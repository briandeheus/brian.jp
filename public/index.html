                <p>I love a good pint.
The cheekier the better.
What makes a pint cheeky?
I’m not one to tell you what makes a pint cheeky or not.
Follow your heart.
But let me tell you about my cheekiest one.
A cataclysmic one.
In 2022 my marriage was coming to an end.
You know those books that start off really good?
And then as you get halfway the writing gets stale and boring.
You realize you’re not really enjoying the book anymore.
But it was so good in the beginning, so maybe the next chapter is going to be b…</p>

                <p>Another gloomy post. I’m not really sorry. I need to write about this to clear my mind.
If you’ve read my blog, you know I recently lost my thyroid.
Rather, it was surgically removed. But the end result is the same: no thyroid.
No thyroid means no thyroid hormones. No thyroid hormones means hormone therapy is needed.
Your body is generally amazing at regulating itself.
The brain has a gland that secretes hormones (TSH) to tell the thyroid to make more hormones.
That same gland has sensors for th…</p>

                <p>Chasing a nostalgia high, I recently installed Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (GTA VC or VC) on my computer.
It’s a game set in 80s Miami, heavily influenced by movies such as Scarface.
You could say it’s “Scarface: The Game” and it would be hard to disagree with you.
GTA:VC was made in the early 2000s when compute power wasn’t anywhere near what it is right now.
The PC requirements start at 128MiB RAM, which in this day and age is unthinkable.
But back then it was used to create a rich game world …</p>

                <p>What sparked the cancer diagnosis in December was thyrotoxicosis. A thyroid storm.
A lil’ rave thrown by your thyroid, and your whole body is invited.
That beautiful, butterfly-shaped organ wrapped around your trachea controls your metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, mood—among other things.
Usually, it just does its job. But sometimes, it doesn’t.
And when it doesn’t? Everything speeds up or shuts down.
The end result is the same: you feel like shit.
So in addition to cancer, which was Lo…</p>

                <p>When my daughter, Megumi, was born in 2014 I made a conscious decision to speak to her in English.
My reasoning was that the English language would get her a lot further than fluency in Dutch at an early age.
I tried to talk Dutch with Megumi when she was four years old, but alas the proverbial ship had sailed and she
resisted learning the language of (50% of) her home country. She now speaks English and Japanese fluently, however.
She aced her Eiken not too long ago either. A small humble brag,…</p>

                <p>Here’s my spiced cake recipe. No backstory.
Ingredients:

250 g all-purpose flour
8 g baking powder
150 g dark brown sugar
8 g ground cinnamon
1 g ground cloves
1 g ground nutmeg
1 g salt
2 eggs (approx. 100 g total)
200 ml whole milk
100 ml neutral vegetable oil (e.g. sunflower)
50g of raisins

Recipe:
Turn on your oven, preheat it to 170~ degrees C or around there.
Add the dry ingredients into one bowl, wet ingredients in the next.
Mix together the dry ingredients. Make sure to use a sieve or …</p>

                <p>We recently moved our Mastodon server Famichiki to a Japanese VPS.
It used to be hosted on servers of an American company, but given the state of the U.S.
and the increasingly hostile rhetoric toward its allies, it felt inappropriate to continue to send
money to U.S. companies. Also, being an instance for users in Japan, the very least we could do
is spend our money on a Japanese company to provide us with hosting.
So now we’re hosted on Conoha, a Japanese company whose parent, GMO,
is arguably …</p>

                <p>Last week the kind doctors at Hospital B performed a biopsy on my thyroid. I have never done a biopsy before,
and I wish to never do one ever again. However, I don’t think I’ll escape that. And you’ll find out why in a bit.
If you’ve been on the internet long enough, you’re probably familiar with these two phrases:

You’re now breathing manually
You’re now aware that you’re blinking

And just like that, you have become aware of two parts of your nervous system that are highly automated
and that …</p>

I was waiting for approval for a blood test. Let me give you a quick timeline.

d-day: “Hello, what is the status of this blood test?”


Insurance: “We are waiting for your hospital to provide us with additional information.”


*Hospital: “We will call you back.”

                <p>I have thyroid cancer. Finally something new to blog about.
If you frequent my blog or follow me on Mastodon, you know that early December I was hospitalized following a thyroid storm.
A thyroid storm is when your thyroid decides to release all your stored thyroid hormones at once.
Your metabolism shoots up. Your heart rate shoots up. Your anxiety goes through the roof.
And if you’re unlucky the credits to your life start rolling.
I was lucky enough that it was a mild storm, and after 2 days in …</p>
